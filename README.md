# Treehouse Android Techdegree Project 1: Guess How Many Are in the Jar

This is a simple console application written in Java. The application will prompt the user for an item to put in a jar and then the maximum number of items that can be contained in the jar. It will then "fill" the jar with a random number of the specified item. The user is then prompted to guess the number of items in the jar until they guess correctly and win the game.
